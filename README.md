# 🌐 SkyFabric

✨ **SkyFabric** is a **central system** that lets you describe **what you want**,  and then **handles everything needed to make it run and stay healthy** across cloud environments.

🧠 You tell SkyFabric **your intent**:
> “I want my service running in production, always available, and not expensive.”

⚙️ SkyFabric then:
- Decides **where** it should run ☁️
- Deploys it **correctly** 🚀
- Continuously **watches it** 👀
- **Fixes issues or alerts humans** when something goes wrong 🚨

🤝 You stop manually managing infrastructure.  
🎯 You focus on building software.  

💡 **In short:**  
SkyFabric replaces cloud chaos with **one calm, central control** 🌈

## 🧩 Real-Life Problems Developers Face (Without SkyFabric)

> In many real companies, infrastructure is spread across clouds:
> - **AWS** for backend services  
> - **GCP** for data and analytics  
> - **Azure** for authentication or enterprise integrations  

| 🚧 Core Problem Area | 😣 What Developers Actually Face in Real Life |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fragmented environments | Backend on AWS, data on GCP, auth on Azure — no single place to manage everything |
| Manual service deployments | Separate deployment logic and workflows for each cloud and environment |
| No single source of truth | Unclear which service version is running where and with which configuration |
| Configuration drift | Manual changes in one cloud silently break production stability |
| Slow incident response | During outages, teams first struggle to identify **which cloud** is failing |
| Inconsistent security rules | Strong IAM rules in one cloud, misconfigured or open access in another |
| Hidden cost behavior | AWS, GCP, and Azure bills grow independently with no unified explanation |

💡 **These problems appear daily in real production teams and grow worse as systems scale across clouds.**

## 🔄 How SkyFabric Changes the Developer Experience (Before → After)

| 🚧 Without SkyFabric (Before) | ✅ With SkyFabric (After) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Services managed separately across AWS, GCP, and Azure | One central system manages services across all clouds |
| Manual, cloud-specific deployments | One intent-driven deployment flow |
| Engineers unsure what is running where | Clear visibility into service state and placement |
| Configuration drift causes unexpected failures | Desired state defined once and continuously enforced |
| Slow and confusing incident investigation | Faster detection of mismatches and failures |
| Security rules differ per cloud | Consistent security and access enforcement |
| Cost issues discovered only after billing | Central visibility into cost-related behavior |

💡 **With SkyFabric, developers describe what they want once,  
and the platform takes responsibility for making reality match that intent.**
